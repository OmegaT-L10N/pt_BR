<h3>Requirements</h3>

<h4>System requirements</h4>

<p>OmegaT will run on any system on which the appropriate JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
has been or can be installed. The JRE is now supplied with OmegaT and need not
be obtained separately. OmegaT has been successfully installed on Windows (all
versions from 98 onwards), Macintosh OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Files in Microsoft Office XML format can be translated directly in OmegaT.
Files in older MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint formats can be translated
following conversion to the equivalent current Microsoft Office formats, or
alternatively to the Office Open XML format, which can be done in
OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice (also free). To obtain OpenOffice.org or
LibreOffice, follow the link from "Third-party software" button on the
left.</p>

<h4>User requirements</h4>
<p>OmegaT is not particularly difficult to install or use, but it does require
a willingness to read and follow the instructions. If you have a natural
aversion to reading instructions, and your approach to new software is to click
on every button you see until something resembling the desired effect occurs,
then OmegaT is probably not suitable for you.</p><!-- Donation slider -->

<h3 id="standard">Standard Version - {{site.data.versions.standard.name}}</h3>

<p>The Standard version requires Java {{site.data.versions.standard.java_version}}. It has usually been in use for some time and is therefore
proven. Its documentation, at least in English, is usually reasonably up to
date. It will however lack some of the features of the "Latest" version.</p>

<h3 id="latest">Latest Version - {{site.data.versions.latest.name}}</h3>

<p>The Latest version requires Java {{site.data.versions.latest.java_version}}. It is a more recent version than the Standard version and
includes new features not present in the latter. The Latest version will
usually be reasonably stable and usable, but may have some bugs. Documentation,
particularly of new features, will be less comprehensive than that of the
Standard version. Users who already have some experience with OmegaT often
prefer the Latest version.</p>

<h3 id="downloadTrunk">Developer Version</h3>

<p>The "/trunk" version is a cutting-edge, "alpha" version, still in
development. Pre-built binaries, are available as Nightly Builds.</p>

  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Legacy versions</h3>

<p>You can still find <a href="{{ site.data.downloads.legacy }}">older, superseded versions</a> of OmegaT.</p>

<p>Legacy versions are older versions that have been superseded. For most
users, these are not of interest. However, some users may face restrictions
(imposed by their operating systems or Java version) that may result in a
preference for an older version.</p>

<h3>With/without JRE</h3>

<p>In order to run, OmegaT requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on your computer.</p>

<p>If you are confident that a suitable version of the JRE is already installed on your computer, you can download a version of OmegaT without the JRE. The download will be faster, and the installation will require less
space on your hard drive. In this case, do not select the Default version; select a different version (e.g. Standard or Latest), then select a version marked "Java not included".</p>

<p>If you install the OmegaT version with JRE even though the JRE is already installed on your computer, OmegaT's JRE will be installed separately and will not conflict with it. It is therefore always safe to install the version of OmegaT with JRE. If you are unsure whether or not you have a suitable version of the JRE, select a version with JRE (or the Default version).  </p>

<p><strong>Mac OS X users</strong>: the JRE is installed on Mac OS X by default; there is therefore no version for Mac OS X with the JRE.</p>

<p><strong>Linux users</strong>: most Linux distributions are supplied with a Java Runtime Environment, but some open-source implementations do not work properly with OmegaT (although this may not be immediately apparent). If you are relatively new to Linux, we advise you to select an OmegaT version with the JRE included. More experienced Linux users may prefer to install the Oracle (formerly Sun) JRE at system level.

<div id="popover_content_osx_signed" style="display:none">
<h4 id="about_signing">Signed/Unsigned</h4>

<p>Mac OS X has a feature called Gatekeeper that increases security by making it difficult to run unsigned programs. OmegaT for Mac OS X is available in both signed and unsigned versions; they are functionally identical, but the signed version is preferred as it is recognized by the system as being published by a known developer.</p>

<p>There may be a delay in publishing signed versions. Users in a hurry can use the unsigned version instead; if you have difficulty launching the app, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph14369">how to open an app from an unidentified developer</a>.</p>
